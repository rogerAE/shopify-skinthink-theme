We chose these bottles over traditional airless pumps because the metal springs in most pumps guarantee they canâ€™t be recycled. Even though our plastic bottles are fully recyclable, we get that most plastic doesnâ€™t end up getting recycled and weâ€™re working on partnering with a recycling organization to ensure every bottle gets recycled.Â </li></ul><p><strong>Secondary packaging</strong></p><ul><li>Our product boxes are fully recyclable and made from virgin pulp paper. We are looking to use FSC-certified paper once we can meet the minimum order quantities for this material.Â </li></ul><p><strong>Shipping</strong></p><ul><li>When you get your package you wonâ€™t see any extra packaging or unnecessary fluff like stickers or fancy paper in your order. Shipping materials create tremendous amounts of waste so weâ€™re skipping whatever isnâ€™t needed.Â </li></ul><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><ul><li>Since the majority of the ingredients we use are lab-created, they have a much smaller carbon footprint than their wild harvested counterparts. We also have much better visibility into the product lifecycle and can ensure weâ€™re sourcing from raw ingredient supplier who engage in fair business practices.Â </li></ul><p>Weâ€™re just getting started on our journey, so everything is a work in progress. As we scale weâ€™ll be able to invest more and solidify our commitment to being as sustainable as possible while still being honest and transparent.Â </p>"
