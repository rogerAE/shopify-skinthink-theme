We excluded a lot of the ingredients you may find in other moisturizers for acne-prone skin that can increase something called lipid peroxidation which leads to inflammation and breakouts.

Super Sensa utilizes a 4% concentration of Niacinamide. This concentration is still clinically effective and minimizes the risk of adverse reactions. </p>"

The break-even point for refillable packaging to outweigh the benefits of single-use packaging is anywhere from 10 to 20 repurchases of the original product. We donâ€™t think this is particularly realistic, especially for a skincare product so weâ€™re skipping the refillable trend for now.Â </p>"
