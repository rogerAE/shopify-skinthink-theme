If all signs look clear, you’re safe for regular use!</p><p><strong>Regular use: </strong>Apply a small amount to your skin twice daily, at morning and at night, to clean, slightly damp skin.

We excluded a lot of the ingredients you may find in other moisturizers for acne-prone skin that can increase something called lipid peroxidation which leads to inflammation and breakouts.

Super Sensa utilizes a 4% concentration of Niacinamide. This concentration is still clinically effective and minimizes the risk of adverse reactions. </p>"

The break-even point for refillable packaging to outweigh the benefits of single-use packaging is anywhere from 10 to 20 repurchases of the original product. We don’t think this is particularly realistic, especially for a skincare product so we’re skipping the refillable trend for now. </p>"
