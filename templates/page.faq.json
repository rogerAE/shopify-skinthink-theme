If anything develops, we re-formulate the preservative system and re-test. </li><li><strong>Human Repeat Insult Patch Testing (HRIPT):</strong> This test is conducted on 50 human volunteers over a period of weeks under clinical supervision.

We chose these bottles over traditional airless pumps because the metal springs in most pumps guarantee they can’t be recycled. Even though our plastic bottles are fully recyclable, we get that most plastic doesn’t end up getting recycled and we’re working on partnering with a recycling organization to ensure every bottle gets recycled. </li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Secondary packaging</strong></p><ul><li>Our product boxes are fully recyclable and made from virgin pulp paper. We are looking to use FSC-certified paper once we can meet the minimum order quantities for this material. </li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Shipping</strong></p><ul><li>When you get your package you won’t see any extra packaging or unnecessary fluff like stickers or fancy paper in your order. Shipping materials create tremendous amounts of waste so we’re skipping whatever isn’t needed. </li></ul><p><br/></p><p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p><ul><li>Since the majority of the ingredients we use are lab-created, they have a much smaller carbon footprint than their wild harvested counterparts. We also have much better visibility into the product lifecycle and can ensure we’re sourcing from raw ingredient supplier who engage in fair business practices.</li></ul><p><br/></p><p>We’re just getting started on our journey, so everything is a work in progress.
