And bonus, it's safe for Fungal Acne too. </p><p>How did I do it? I substituted the traditional L-Ascorbic Acid with a new vitamin C derivative called Aminopropyl Ascorbyl Phosphate and added in a blend of actives that help to target oxidative stress, lipid peroxidation, dehydration, and irritation. I also included potent tyrosinase inhibitors that help to target and fade discoloration in all skin tones.  </p><p>What's not in it? I excluded common ingredients you may find in other antioxidant serums like L-ascorbic acid, alcohol and glycols.  While these ingredients definitely aren't bad, they give a lot of folks with acne-prone and sensitive skin troubles so I skipped them altogether.    </p><p>                                                              - Christina, Founder Authentic Ego</p><p></p><p></p>"
